A simple dynamic queue I coded in my free time between classes. 
Has some basic operations for dynamic queues and tests 3 queues:
a queue with many nodes (10 in this case which is to test queues with 3+ nodes),
a queue with only 2 nodes, and a queue with only 1 node. 
Also utilizes an abstract base class with pure virtual functions to derive the LinkedQueue class.
